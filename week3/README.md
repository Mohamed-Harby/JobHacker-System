**Task 5:** Write a program that takes an array of integers and checks whether the array is sorted in ascending order.

**Task 6:** Write a program that takes a number as input and prints the factorial of that number.

**Task 7:** Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and counts the number of elements that are greater than a specific value.

**Task 8:** Write a program that takes two arrays of integers and returns a new array that contains only the elements that are common to both arrays.

**Task 9:** Write a program that takes an array of integers and finds the second largest number in the array.
