### Task 1 Online Shop:
Develop a simplified online shop system where users can add products to a shopping cart, view the total cost, and place an order.

You can define classes for product, shopping cart, and order processing.

- Define the **Product** class to represent individual products. Each product has **a name and a price**.
- Define the **ShoppingCart** class to manage the shopping cart functionality.
  It should have methods to add and remove items, calculate the total cost, and retrieve the items in the cart.
- Define the **OrderProcessor** class to handle order processing.
  - It should have a placeOrder method,
  - Actually in this method we should have a big logic. But now in our example, please simply print the order details (each item and price) and total cost for the cart.
  
- In the main method, we create some sample products, create a shopping cart, add products to the cart, and then display the total cost. Finally, we create an instance of **OrderProcessor** and use it to place the order, which will print the order details.

**Note*** handle all exception ex:
- price cannot be less than 0
- And Make ValidationUtil to validate on String (cannot be null or empty)
